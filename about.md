Driftwood is a test project for the purpose of creating a lightweight and easy tool for hosting and serving podcasts on Github using Jekyll. Additionally, the goal is to be able to record, edit, and post using just a mobile device like an iPhone or iPad. 

# Host

I'm just a guy who likes playing with code. You can find me on Twitter [@LK64076007A](https://twitter.com/LK64076007A) or my [blog](http://soitscometothis.net).
